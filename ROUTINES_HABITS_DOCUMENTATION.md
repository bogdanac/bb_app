# Routines & Habits System Documentation

## Overview

The BB App includes a comprehensive Routines & Habits system designed to help users build and maintain daily routines and long-term habits. The system provides both Flutter app functionality and Android widget integration for seamless user experience.

## ðŸ”„ Routines System

### Core Concepts

**Routine**: A collection of sequential steps/tasks that are performed regularly (e.g., morning routine, evening routine)
- Each routine has a title, list of items, reminder settings, and active days
- Supports step-by-step execution with completion tracking
- Can be scheduled for specific days of the week

**RoutineItem**: Individual steps within a routine
- Has text description and completion status (completed/skipped/pending)
- Can be marked as completed or skipped without removing from list
- Progress persists throughout the day

### Data Models

#### Routine (`lib/Routines/routine_data_models.dart:2-67`)
```dart
class Routine {
  final String id;
  String title;
  List<RoutineItem> items;
  bool reminderEnabled;
  int reminderHour;
  int reminderMinute;
  Set<int> activeDays; // 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, ..., 7=Sunday
}
```

#### RoutineItem (`lib/Routines/routine_data_models.dart:69-95`)
```dart
class RoutineItem {
  final String id;
  String text;
  bool isCompleted;
  bool isSkipped;
}
```

### Key Features

#### 1. Day-Based Scheduling
- Routines can be configured to run on specific days (weekdays, weekends, or custom combinations)
- Active day logic determines which routine is displayed today
- Supports "effective date" concept (considers times before 2 AM as previous day)

#### 2. Progress Tracking
- **Daily Reset**: Progress automatically resets each day
- **Persistent Progress**: Step completion survives app restarts within the same day
- **Skip vs Complete**: Steps can be completed (done) or skipped (postponed)
- **Smart Navigation**: Automatically moves to next unfinished step

#### 3. Morning Routine Card
The home screen displays an active morning routine card with:
- Current step display
- Complete/Skip action buttons
- Progress indicator (completed/total steps)
- "Not Today" option to hide the card
- Smart step navigation (finds next unfinished or skipped step)

### Services Architecture

#### RoutineService (`lib/Routines/routine_service.dart`)
Main service handling routine data and logic:
- `loadRoutines()`: Loads all routines from SharedPreferences
- `saveRoutines()`: Saves routines and updates notifications/widget
- `findMorningRoutine()`: Finds active morning routine for today
- `setActiveRoutineForToday()`: Manual override for routine selection
- Provides default morning routine on first launch

#### RoutineProgressService (`lib/Routines/routine_progress_service.dart`)
Unified progress tracking service:
- `markRoutineInProgress()`: Marks routine as actively being performed
- `saveRoutineProgress()`: Saves current step and completion status
- `loadRoutineProgress()`: Loads today's progress for a routine
- `getInProgressRoutineId()`: Returns which routine is currently active

#### RoutineWidgetService (`lib/Routines/routine_widget_service.dart`)
Bridges Flutter and Android widget:
- `updateWidget()`: Syncs current routine data to Android widget
- `refreshWidgetColor()`: Updates widget background color

## ðŸŽ¯ Habits System

### Core Concepts

**Habit**: A behavior or activity to be performed daily, tracked over 21-day cycles
- Each habit tracks completion dates and streak information
- Uses 21-day cycle system for habit formation
- Supports multiple cycles for long-term habit building

### Data Models

#### Habit (`lib/Habits/habit_data_models.dart:4-145`)
```dart
class Habit {
  final String id;
  String name;
  bool isActive;
  DateTime createdAt;
  List<String> completedDates; // 'yyyy-MM-dd' format
  int currentCycle;
  bool isCompleted;
}
```

#### HabitStatistics (`lib/Habits/habit_data_models.dart:147-213`)
Comprehensive statistics for habit analysis:
- Current and longest streaks
- Completion rates (weekly, monthly, all-time)
- Monthly completion statistics
- Total completed days

### Key Features

#### 1. 21-Day Cycle System
- Each habit follows 21-day cycles for habit formation

#### 2. Streak Tracking
- Current streak calculation (consecutive completed days)
- Longest streak tracking over habit lifetime
- Streak display in habit cards and statistics

#### 3. Flexible Completion Tracking
- Daily completion toggle (can mark/unmark for today)
- Date-based completion storage
- Completion rate analysis over different time periods

#### 4. Active/Inactive States
- Habits can be temporarily deactivated without losing data
- Only active habits appear in daily tracking
- Inactive habits preserved for future reactivation

### Services Architecture

#### HabitService (`lib/Habits/habit_service.dart`)
Main service for habit management:
- `loadHabits()` / `saveHabits()`: Data persistence
- `getActiveHabits()`: Returns only currently active habits
- `toggleHabitCompletion()`: Marks/unmarks habit for today
- `hasUncompletedHabitsToday()`: Checks if any habits remain unfinished
- `cleanupOldData()`: Removes completion data older than 1 year

### UI Components

2. **Progress Loading**: Loads any existing progress for today
3. **Step Execution**: User completes/skips steps sequentially  
4. **Progress Saving**: Each action saves progress immediately
5. **Widget Sync**: Changes propagate to Android widget
6. **Daily Reset**: New day clears progress and starts fresh

### Habit Tracking Flow
1. **Daily Display**: Active habits appear on home screen
2. **Completion Toggle**: User marks habits as done/undone
3. **Streak Calculation**: System updates streak counters
4. **Cycle Progress**: Tracks progress within 21-day cycles
5. **Statistics Update**: All analytics update in real-time

### Cross-Platform Synchronization
- **SharedPreferences**: Primary data storage for both Flutter and Android
- **Key Prefixing**: Flutter automatically adds 'flutter.' prefix to keys
- **Dual Format Storage**: Routines saved in both Flutter and Android-compatible formats
- **Real-time Updates**: Widget updates immediately when app data changes

## ðŸ“Š Storage & Persistence

### Data Storage Architecture
- **SharedPreferences**: Primary storage mechanism for all routine and habit data
- **JSON Serialization**: All objects serialize to/from JSON for storage
- **Key Namespacing**: Organized key structure prevents data conflicts

### Storage Keys
- `routines`: List of all routines (JSON array)
- `routine_progress_{routineId}_{date}`: Daily progress for specific routine
- `morning_routine_progress_{date}`: Legacy morning routine progress
- `active_routine_{date}`: Currently in-progress routine
- `habits`: List of all habits (JSON array)
- `widget_background_color`: User-selected widget color

### Data Cleanup
- **Daily Reset**: Routine progress automatically expires after effective date
- **Habit Cleanup**: Old completion data (>1 year) automatically removed
- **Widget Sync**: Periodic cleanup of stale widget data

## ðŸŽ¨ User Experience Features
